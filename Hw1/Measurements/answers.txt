      L1: s1 ping -c 20 s2 >> latency_L1.txt
      L2: s2 ping -c 20 s3 >> latency_L2.txt
      L3: s2 ping -c 20 s4 >> latency_L3.txtc

2)    Predicted throughput: 18.00 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 60 ms or 120 ms RTT
      Actual throughput: 19.35000 Mbps
      Actual latency: 122.593 ms
      Explanation of results: Latency should be 
      the combined delays of all the links. Throughput 
      is limited by the smallest bandwidth which is 20 
      bytes on link 1.

3.1)  Predicted throughput: 9.00 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 60 ms or 120 ms RTT
      Actual throughput: 13.882400 Mbps and 10.611840 Mbps
      Actual latency: 122.249 ms RTT
      Explanation of results: Latency should not change from 
      Q2 as the medium upon which the data is trasnferred is 
      still the same. However, throughput should  be halved, 
      as the pairs of hosts must now share the same bandwidth. 
      One may have a higher throughput because starting it first
      may have given it a head start and more resource allocation. 
      The second started pair has a closer throughput to the 
      prediction at 10.611840 Mbps

3.2)  Predicted throughput: 6 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 60 msor 120 ms RTT
      Actual throughput: 14.540267 Mbps and 6.416296 Mbps and 6.171077 Mbps
      Actual latency: 122.573 ms RTT
      Explanation of results: Latency should not change as medium of 
      transmission has not changed. The 2 second delays may come from
      processes and distance the transmission needs to travel. As for 
      throughput, the last 2 pairs were close to the predicted throughput 
      of roughly 6 Mbps. However the first had a throughput of 14.5 Mbps 
      which was started first. Not quite sure why, but maybe starting it 
      first gives it resource priorities and more time to transmit. Otherwise, 
      the bandwidth should be divided equally amongst all three pairs.
      
4)    Predicted throughput: 9.00 Mbps for both since they share 2 links
      Predicted latency: h3 and h8 at 15 ms or 30 ms RTT and h1 and h10 at 60 ms or 120 ms RTT
      Actual throughput: h3/h8 at 16.138462 Mbps and h1/h10 at 7.713600 Mbps
      Actual latency: h3/h8: 31.320 and h1/h10: 122.082
      Explanation of results: Latency should just be the combination of delays 
      on all the links as the medium does not change. Transfer rate remains the 
      same. Output h3/h8 has higher output due to shorter distance travelled and 
      hence the higher Mbps.
